In the given linked list, the head node has a value of 1 and the next node has a value of 2. The second node points back to the head node, which creates a cycle in the linked list.

The input also specifies that the cycle starts at the 0th position, which means the head node is also the start of the cycle.

Therefore, the linked list is cyclic, and the output should be true.
